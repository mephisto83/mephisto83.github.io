/* This is the time, in absolute timecents, for a 100% change in the Volume Envelope value during decay phase. For the
 * Volume Envelope, the decay phase linearly ramps toward the sustain level, causing a constant dB change for each time
 * unit. If the sustain level were -100dB, the Volume Envelope Decay Time would be the time spent in decay phase. A
 * value of 0 indicates a 1-second decay time for a zero-sustain level. A negative value indicates a time less than one
 * second; a positive value a time longer than one second. For example, a decay time of 10 msec would be 1200log2(.01)
 * = -7973. */
