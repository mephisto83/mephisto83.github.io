/* This is the decrease in level, expressed in 0.1% units, to which the Modulation Envelope value ramps during the
 * decay phase. For the Modulation Envelope, the sustain level is properly expressed in percent of full scale. Because
 * the volume envelope sustain level is expressed as an attenuation from full scale, the sustain level is analogously
 * expressed as a decrease from full scale. A value of 0 indicates the sustain level is full level; this implies a zero
 * duration of decay phase regardless of decay time. A positive value indicates a decay to the corresponding level.
 * Values less than zero are to be interpreted as zero; values above 1000 are to be interpreted as 1000. For example, a
 * sustain level which corresponds to an absolute value 40% of peak would be 600. */
